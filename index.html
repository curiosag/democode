				<h3>ELT</h3>
				<div>
					application/business-logic as triggers and Pl/Sql. <br> <br>ETL-Jobs
					(or ELT, if you like) jobs were done in Oracle entirely, eventually
					feeding a master data management system, also on Oracle. <br>
					<br>Initial extraction was done with Oracle Loader, loading <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/ETL/LoaderFiles/RatingLoaderA.dat">comma
						separated </a> and <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/ETL/LoaderFiles/RatingLoaderB.dat">fixed
						length </a> formats to <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/tree/master/Oracle/ETL/DDL">staging
						tables</a>, non-recoverable and non-logged in append mode. Wherever
					possible type conversion was left to the loader too, as in the
					examples shown. <br> <br>Where not, type conversion was
					handled in <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/ETL/PlSql/v_price_transf_eval.sql">
						transformation views</a>, usually simultaneously with the application
					of business rules. The latter could be rather elaborate functions
					like the peculiar amend date decoding in <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/ETL/PlSql/PRO%23.pkb">
						this package</a> (check_amenddt, test_amend_date), where also the
					default insert-from-view error handling is shown (load_data). <br>
					<br>In one case I was happy to find an occasion to apply a <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/ETL/PlSql/PipelinedFunctionConvertRawRecord.sql">
						parallel pipelined function </a> (plus the related <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/ETL/PlSql/TransformRawRecord%23.pkb">
						implementing package </a> for the decoding proper) to extract raw
					values from a colon-separated-key-value-pairs format to feed a <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/ETL/PlSql/v_transform_price.sql">
						subsequent transformation view </a> and <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/ETL/PlSql/TransformAndLoad%23.pkb">
						loading </a> to the final staging table. In this case the <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/ETL/LoaderFiles/TrivialLoader.dat">Oracle
						loader file</a> is trivial. <br> <br>Business rule views
					also could come in their own right, like in <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/ETL/PlSql/v_cp_rating_eval.sql">
						this example</a> , where the analytical functions of Oracle handed
					themselves nicely to implemented a given set of requirements. <br>
					<br>Rating processing for different providers proved to be
					uniform enough to apply the same strategy to all of them <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/ETL/PlSql/RTG_UTIL%23.pkb">by
						constructing sql at runtime </a> (uniform table names were no option).
					Access to the master data was the bottleneck, therefore caching
					(g_mdm_classnames, FUNCTION get_class_name) and one time copies of
					relevant master data (e.g. rating symbols, PROCEDURE
					collect_symbols) were employed and table statistics kept up to date
					(gather_table_stats).

				<h3>Master data management synchronization</h3>
				Master data management synchronization usually meant, to apply sanity checks,
				business rules and mappings in Pl/Sql to incoming data and feed the results through a
				Pl/Sql-api to the da"Delphi/DataAccessLayer/uMd.pas"tabase while considering defined mutation rules. The sample is a tiny fraction of
				<a
					href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/Integration/LOAD_INSTRUMENTS%23.pkb">asset
					synchronization</a>, a rather central task. <br> <br>Since
				heavy use of objects was made on all levels, occasionally object
				representations had to be <a
					href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/Integration/deserialize_objects%23.pkb">serialized</a>.
				Aside custom ELT, data traveled via Xml messaging, including <a
					href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/Integration/XmlGen%23.pkb">creation
					and sending</a> as well as consumption. The latter used <a
					href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/Integration/XmlDomManipulation%23.pkb">DOM-access</a>
				and <a
					href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/Integration/XmlXQuery%23.pkb">XQuery</a>.

						A study to use Linq syntax to express <a
							href="https://github.com/curiosag/MicroWorkflow/tree/master/DataProcessingByLinq/Program.cs">data
							processing sequences</a> with the goal to create non-graphical
						workflow definitions that can be suspended, persisted and resumed.
						It is possible, but very limited. F# computation sequences could
						be used the same way btw, being more expressive.
					</p>
					<p>
						A byproduct that eventually became production code was a simple
						high level <a
							href="https://github.com/curiosag/MicroWorkflow/blob/master/DataProcessingByLinq/Ftp/Ftp.cs">ftp
							class</a> with specialized subclasses to provide straight forward ftp
						functionality, implemented with .net web requests, and <a
							href="https://github.com/curiosag/MicroWorkflow/blob/master/DataProcessingByLinq/Ftp/FileBasedFtpEmulator.cs">emulated
							ftp</a> functionality operating on the file system. The latter was
						used to emulate the ftp delivery logic of different data
						providers.

					<p>
						Proof of concept and pilot application - generate an <a
							href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/DotNet/TkModel/TkMeta/FromXsd/Doc.cs">object
							model</a> from meta-data definitions of a certain data provider and
						show, that it is possible to <a
							href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/DotNet/TkModel/TkMeta/SampleQuery_Baskets.cs">re-implement
							existing sql-queries</a> on that data-feed using the object model and
						Linq. The final model provided by another party was closely
						related. On that I based <a
							href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/DotNet/TkModel/Extractions/Extraction.cs">core
							elements</a> of the initial implementation of <a
							href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/DotNet/TkModel/Extractions/BondMonNormalizer.cs">
							extractions</a>, thought it was not appropriate to mimic Sql there.

						Elements of a client-server framework, splitting an existing
						monolithic implementation into a client part that runs, monitors
						and controls sequences of data processing and a server part,
						responsible for execution and resource allocation for multiple
						client requests. Requests came in form of data processing messages
						(<a
							href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Delphi/ClientServerFramework/uDpMessageCommon.pas">TDpMessageCommon</a>),
						bundling sequences of commands and their execution parameters. The
						server translates (<a

						<a
							href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Delphi/ClientServerFramework/uActionFactoryFetchExternalData.pas">uActionFactoryFetchExternalData</a>)
						them to actions (<a

						<a
							href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Delphi/ClientServerFramework/uDbActions.pas">uDbActions</a>)

						Elements of a generic storage and data retrieval framework, that I
						implemented following an abstract design (<a
							href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Delphi/DataAccessLayer/uDataAccessLayer_a.pas">uDataAccessLayer_a</a>)
						aimed at the provider structure level. Everything down to the
						physical tables had to be spelled out. It supports native
						simultaneous access to Oracle, Db2 (including transparent DML
						array loading), DbIsam and non-natively anything that BDE
						supported. Data writing is tree oriented and handles update
						operations transparently for using classes. It is meta-data
						driven, meta-data is a terse pointer structure roughly like <a
							href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Delphi/DataAccessLayer/uMd.pas">this</a>
						one. The abstract level was backed by custom classes and
						eventually by a general table access layer (<a
							href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Delphi/DataAccessLayer/uCustomTableAccess.pas">uCustomTableAccess</a>)
						with database specific implementations, hiding the nasty details.
						For examples of nasty details see <a
							href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Delphi/DataAccessLayer/uOraTableExt.	pas">uOraTableExt</a>,
						<a
							href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Delphi/DataAccessLayer/uSQLFormat_DB2.pas">uSQLFormat_DB2</a>
						and <a
							href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Delphi/DataAccessLayer/uDB2Writer.pas">uDB2Writer</a>.
						Database structures get generated from meta-data and can be
						altered automatically on meta-data changes.
