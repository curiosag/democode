				<div>
					application/business-logic as triggers and Pl/Sql. <br> <br>ELT-Jobs
					were sort of everything-within-oracle version of ETL, eventually
					feeding a master data management system, also on Oracle. <br>
					<br>Initial extraction was done with Oracle Loader, loading <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/ETL/LoaderFiles/RatingLoaderA.dat"  target="_blank">comma
						separated </a> and <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/ETL/LoaderFiles/RatingLoaderB.dat"  target="_blank">fixed
						length </a> formats to <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/tree/master/Oracle/ETL/DDL"  target="_blank">staging
						tables</a>, non-recoverable and non-logged in append mode. Wherever
					possible type conversion was left to the loader too, as in the
					examples shown. <br> <br>Where not, type conversion was
					handled in <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/ETL/PlSql/v_price_transf_eval.sql"  target="_blank">
						transformation views</a>, usually simultaneously with the application
					of business rules. The latter could be rather elaborate functions
					like the peculiar amend date decoding in <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/ETL/PlSql/PRO%23.pkb"  target="_blank">
						this package</a> (check_amenddt, test_amend_date), where also the
					default insert-from-view error handling is shown (load_data). <br>
					<br>In one case I was happy to find an occasion to apply a <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/ETL/PlSql/PipelinedFunctionConvertRawRecord.sql"  target="_blank">
						parallel pipelined function </a> (plus the related <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/ETL/PlSql/TransformRawRecord%23.pkb"  target="_blank">
						implementing package </a> for the decoding proper) to extract raw
					values from a colon-separated-key-value-pairs format to feed a <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/ETL/PlSql/v_transform_price.sql"  target="_blank">
						subsequent transformation view </a> and <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/ETL/PlSql/TransformAndLoad%23.pkb"  target="_blank">
						loading </a> to the final staging table. In this case the <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/ETL/LoaderFiles/TrivialLoader.dat"  target="_blank">Oracle
						loader file</a> is trivial. <br> <br>Business rule views
					also could come in their own right, like in <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/ETL/PlSql/v_cp_rating_eval.sql"  target="_blank">
						this example</a> from rating processing, where the analytical
					functions of Oracle handed themselves nicely to implement a given
					set of requirements. <br> <br>Rating processing for
					different providers proved to be uniform enough to apply the same
					strategy to all of them <a
						href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/ETL/PlSql/RTG_UTIL%23.pkb"  target="_blank">by
						constructing sql at runtime </a> (uniform table names were no option).
					Access to the master data was the bottleneck, therefore caching
					(g_mdm_classnames, FUNCTION get_class_name) and one time copies of
					relevant master data (e.g. rating symbols, PROCEDURE
					collect_symbols) were employed and table statistics kept up to date
					(gather_table_stats).

				<h3>Master data management synchronization</h3>
				Master data management synchronization usually meant, to apply
				sanity checks, business rules and mappings in Pl/Sql to incoming
				data and feed the results through a Pl/Sql-api to the database while
				considering defined mutation rules. The sample is a tiny fraction of
				<a
					href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/Integration/LOAD_INSTRUMENTS%23.pkb"  target="_blank">asset
					synchronization</a>, a rather central task. <br> <br>Since
				heavy use of objects was made on all levels, occasionally object
				representations had to be <a
					href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/Integration/deserialize_objects%23.pkb"  target="_blank">serialized</a>.
				Aside custom ELT, data traveled via Xml messaging, including <a
					href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/Integration/XmlGen%23.pkb"  target="_blank">creation
					and sending</a> as well as consumption. The latter used <a
					href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/Integration/XmlDomManipulation%23.pkb"  target="_blank">DOM-access</a>
				and <a
					href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Oracle/Integration/XmlXQuery%23.pkb"  target="_blank">XQuery</a>.

							existing sql-queries</a> on that data-feed using the object model and
						Linq. The final model provided by another party was closely
						related. On that I based <a

							production code elements</a> of the initial implementation of <a
							href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/DotNet/TkModel/Extractions/BondMonNormalizer.cs"  target="_blank">

						aimed at the provider structure level. Everything down to the
						physical tables had to be spelled out. It supports native
						simultaneous access to Oracle, Db2 (including transparent DML
						array loading), DbIsam and non-natively anything that BDE
						supported. Data writing is tree oriented and handles update
						operations transparently for using classes. It is meta-data
						driven, meta-data is a terse pointer structure roughly like <a
							href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Delphi/DataAccessLayer/uMd.pas"  target="_blank">this</a>
						one. The abstract level was backed by custom classes and
						eventually by a general table access layer (<a
							href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Delphi/DataAccessLayer/uCustomTableAccess.pas"  target="_blank">uCustomTableAccess</a>)
						with database specific implementations, hiding the nasty details.
						For examples of nasty details see <a

						and <a
							href="https://github.com/curiosag/democode/blob/master/Delphi/DataAccessLayer/uDB2Writer.pas"  target="_blank">uDB2Writer</a>.
						Database structures get generated from meta-data and can be
						altered automatically on meta-data changes.

					<h4>Intelligent Advertisement Scraping Framework</h4>

					<p>
						This began as a personal toy, but now always some friends are on
						the mailing list. I do not want to make it available for the
						public, though, since it gives the technically savvy yet another
						advantage over the not so skilled, like you have it at the<a

						Apache Lucene indexing and query is used for stemming, tokenization, number detection, and fuzzy/word vicinity querying, allowing for queries like "Find matches for keyword 'provision' with an Levensthein edit distance <= 2 and a number token in it's vicinity, not further than 2 words away in either direction". I put it on Google Appengine, using Dygraph charting for some
						visualization. See the stat page of a life specimen <a

						Code is on <a href="https://github.com/curiosag/AdScraperGwt/" target="_blank">github</a>.

<h5>Machine Learing Excursus</h5>
						Seeing the significant amount of <a
							href="http://www.mieterschutzwien.at/index.php/3719/wohnungsbetrug-auf-internetplattformen/" target="_blank">fraudulent
							advertisements</a>, at times up to 40% in the budget range, and the reluctance or inability of some portals to
						provide effective filters and procedures to prevent it, I added some <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">
							machine learning</a> to get rid of it. <br><br> 
It turned out, that valid and invalid ads aren't cleanly separable. First thinking of support vector machines or neuronal networks, eventually a simple logistic classifier with a low detection threshold (0.1) was most suitable for the task. It gives the high precision needed (>96%) in order not to filter valid ads, at the cost of a rather low recall of about 60%, which is acceptable here. <br><br>
This way everything needed in Java was the polynomial&#47;sigmoid evaluation function which was easy to write by hand. The modelling and training part I left in Matlab&#47;Octave script language. <br><br> I should mention, that linear discriminant analysis (LDA) showed a better overall performance, but provided lower precision, which was not preferrable in this case. It gives nice visualizations though, and the intersection of good and bad ads can also be seen there, confirming the initial hypothesis, that unusually low prize per square meter ratio indicates bad ads, though not always. The projection is on price, size and the "contains email" indicator.<br> <img src="./images/3DScatterPlot.gif" alt="" halign="center">
